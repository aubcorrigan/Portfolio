    <p>Polar bears are going extinct primarily due to climate change, which is rapidly melting the sea ice they rely on for survival. These large predators use sea ice as a platform to hunt seals, their main food source, and as it disappears, they are forced to swim longer distances or move onto land, where food is scarce. As a result, many polar bears are becoming malnourished or dying from starvation. Additionally, pollution and oil drilling in the Arctic threaten their habitat and health, while human activity increases the risk of conflict and disturbance. Without urgent action to reduce global warming and protect their environment, polar bears face a growing risk of extinction.</p>
