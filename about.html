      <h2>Hello, I'm Aubrey Corrigan</h2>
      <p> I recently finished my associate’s degree at Olympic College and have now started working on my bachelor’s in Digital Marketing at Bellevue College. I’ve always been drawn to creativity and connecting with people, which is what sparked my interest in marketing.

Since 2022, my sister and I have been sharing our love of baking on social media through Corrigan Sisters, and we also run our food blog, corrigansisters.com, where we post our favorite recipes, tips, and behind-the-scenes moments from our kitchen. It’s been such a fun way to experiment with content creation, learn the ins and outs of social media, and see firsthand what it takes to build an online community around something you love.

In April, we took a big step and started selling homemade crêpes, baked goods, and drinks at our local farmers market. It’s been an exciting adventure, and getting to meet customers, hear their feedback, and see people enjoying something we made from scratch has been incredibly rewarding.

Professionally, I’ve also had the opportunity to work in marketing for a local chiropractor, creating and managing social media content and helping develop marketing strategies. Currently, I’m working at a med spa in Silverdale, WA, where I manage social media, create content, implement SEO strategies, and run email marketing campaigns. It’s been amazing to see how thoughtful marketing and consistent content can really support a brand and engage clients in meaningful ways.

Outside of work and school, I love to bake (of course!), travel, play the piano, explore all things music, and work on my business with my sister. These hobbies keep me inspired, creative, and always learning something new. </p>
