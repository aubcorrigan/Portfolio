      <h2>Welcome to My Portfolio</h2>
<p>On this page you’ll find examples of my web projects that demonstrate the skills I have learned in this course: BATECH189 - Webpage Authoring Essentials! It includes basic HTML, CSS, and responsive design. It's interesting to see the improvement starting from the simplest of webpage (single line) to more elaborate. It was fun learning how using code has so much more potential for creativity of a designer and customization!</p>

        <img src="images/resume.jpg" alt="Screenshot of E-Book Website project">
        <p>This project is a personal resume website that I hand-coded using HTML and CSS. It’s a simple site that shares information about me, my background, and my skills in a clear and easy-to-read way. I wanted to practice building a website completely from scratch, so everything from the structure to the design was written by me.</p>

        <h3>Project 3: Help Save Polar Bears</h3>
        <img src="images/polarbear.jpg" alt="Screenshot of beginner portfolio project">
        <p>This project is about how polar bears are in danger of going extinct. Climate change is melting the ice they need to hunt and live on, making it hard for them to find food. Many are going hungry, and pollution, oil drilling, and human activity are making things worse. If we don’t act soon, polar bears could lose their home for good.</p>

        <p>This project is a simple recipe page I made to share how to bake classic chocolate chip cookies. It walks you through the ingredients, steps, and tips for making them extra tasty. I kept the design clean and easy to follow, just like a quick guide you'd use in the kitchen.</p>
